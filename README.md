For simplicity of description, the abbreviation `ROOT` will be use as the address 
to the folder (including this folder name) where the project is located. It will have this kind of the tree structure:

```
.ROOT
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ search_service
â”œâ”€â”€ nginx
â”œâ”€â”€ postgres
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.example
â””â”€â”€ .env
```

The received or created `.env` file must be placed in the root of the project at `ROOT/.env`.

### <a name="building_image"></a>2.2. Building a project
